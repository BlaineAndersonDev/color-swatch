# Helpful Human Applicant Interview Challenge

Helpful Human's at home proficiency challenge. This challenge gauges applicants' knowledge on a number of different metrics that are used in part to determine an applicant's viability. In this repo, you will find the assets that are required to replicate the design that is also included in this repo. Both .sketch documents are available as well as .pngs.

To get started, clone this repo. Add your work to it in whatever structure you prefer, then push it to your own, renamed repo. When you are finish, share the location of your work with us.

This challenge has different milestones.

## Core
Stated briefly, the core goal is to create a simple but functional app that has a data, view and logic layer. The app will display color swatches, and that's about it!

The core goals should be completed in full. 

## Stretch
The stretch goals can also be met if you choose to do so. Not completing the stretch goals does not disqualify you in any way nor will it lead to a competitive disadvantage to other applicants.

## Bonus Stretch
Bonus stretch goals inherit properties of stretch goals but completing these goals will say to us, "I believe the code I've written for the core goals and the stretch goals is production ready".

## Additional Information
An applicant completing a very well considered solution to the core challenges is just as meaningful to us as a solution that completes all goals but is not implemented as well.

If you'd like to implement additional functionality, or change the functionality of this challenge, feel free but be prepared to discuss your reasoning for doing so. We like critical thinking. We don't like improper implementation without reason.

## Time
Keep track of how much time you spent on the challenge and please spend as much time as you are willing to on this challenge. We know that your time is valuable and also know that doing work without pay is not an ideal scenario.
